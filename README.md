# `ChaoticNetworks`

## Overview

`ChaoticNetworks` is a Rust package designed for advanced graph modeling and simulations. This library leverages `Grothendieck topologies` and `sheaf theory` to provide a robust framework for analyzing and understanding complex networks such as `Hopfield networks` and `chip-firing models`.

## Features
- `Modular design` with a basis in `Category Theory` and `Grothendieck Topology`.
- Integration with `sheaf theory` for consistency and advanced analysis.
- Flexible simulation framework for `Hopfield networks` and `chip-firing systems`.
- `Rust` implementation (potential for future `Python` bindings).


## Libraries
- `src/graph` - Contains the core graph structures and node implementations.
- `src/sheaf` - Manages sheaf and presheaf data, along with sheaf conditions.
- `src/simulation` - Simulation logic for Hopfield networks and chip-firing systems.
- `src/category` - Defines Category Theoeretic structure and Grothendieck topologies.
