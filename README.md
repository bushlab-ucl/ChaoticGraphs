# `ChaoticNetworks`

## Overview

`ChaoticNetworks` is a Rust package designed for graph modeling and simulations. This library aims to provide a robust framework for analyzing and understanding discrete graph networks such as `Hopfield networks` and `chip-firing models`. It's currently a work in progress.

## Features
- Modular design with a basis in category theory and Grothendieck topology.
- Integration with sheaf theory for consistency and advanced analysis.
- Flexible simulation framework for Hopfield networks and chip-firing systems.
- `Rust` implementation - potential for future `Python` bindings.


## Libraries
- `src/category` - Defines category theoeretic structure and Grothendieck topology.
- `src/graph` - Contains the graph structures and node implementations.
- `src/sheaf` - Manages sheaf and presheaf data, along with sheaf conditions.
- `src/simulation` - Simulation logic for Hopfield networks and chip-firing systems.
